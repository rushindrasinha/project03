The following are the best practices that we will use to version control the application 

// git pull origin master (branch)
// never push updates to master branch, this can lead to merge conflicts
// when working on a feature -> git checkout -b branchname and work on that specific branch
// once specific feature is completed -> git push origin branchname 
// use git status often 
// see which branch you're on -> git branch
