### The following are the best practices that we will use to version control the application

1. git pull origin master (branch)
2. never push updates to master branch, this can lead to merge conflicts
3. when working on a feature -> git checkout -b branchname and work on that specific branch
4. once specific feature is completed -> git push origin branchname
5. use git status often
6. see which branch you're on -> git branch
